#2016 United States Election Twitter Tracker

Wrote a python script to collect, analyze and visualize twitter data for the 2016 US Elections.
Collected tweets using Twitter's streaming API and stored them in a mongodb database. 
Wrote a script to find the top 10 hashtags, type of tweets and location data of the 10,000+ tweets. 
Created a simple web app to display the results using python flask.
